What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository sets it up so it can be used to commit changes to files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to logically group sets of files together so they can be committed as one snapshot.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using the "git diff --staged" command just prior to committing, you can see all of the change you are about to commit and ensure that they belong to one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches help to manage multiple versions or releases of the code.  They help by maintaining separate versions of the code base which can be merged at a later time.
